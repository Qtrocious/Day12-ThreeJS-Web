                Ok so, I honestly NEED to lock in. 
                <br>I've had a lot of time to really get the work done, like school and HC stuff, <br>
                <br>I really want to make and org an YSWS, also making a club and a clubs' website.
                Also organizing Campfire seems to be going good! 
                <br><br>But tbh i need more people to know about HC here in México, sooo many teens capable of learning new stuff just by BEING in Hackclub, imagine the possibilities
            </p>

                Before Campfire happens, i hope many fellow mexicans go to the flagship. 
                But for that to happen i need to promote HC events like MilkyWay and Flavortown in IG for people to get excited and sponsors to notice cool stuff are happening for teens, and maybe some in-kind sponsor stuff? jeje. <br><br> So for now i'll focuse on posting flavortown and campfire, and that if they want to prepare for Campfire, they might wanna do Milkyway or FT.

                I was really suprised when I got to Undercity and I was the only Mexican there, makes me wanna get like +20 clubs on the map in México. <br><br> I knew nothing about Hack Club before February. Joined when High Seas was about to end :sob: and looking back, WOW, i really joined at a great moment, Highway to Undercity in, GITHUB HQ????

                From the start i was excited, what do you mean i just needed to do make cool hardware projects and i'd get to fly to SF and spend 4 days in GitHub HQ. Meeting Acon, Alexren and Meghana was an awesome experience. <br><br> Really makes you think you can achieve so much in Hack Club. And that's what makes me keep trying to find ways to participate in HC and make HC known here.

                the blogs workshops are really making me want to start an FT project about a self-hosted blog where people can see it and could be something like "Atrocious ideas" get it? My slack name is Atrocious
